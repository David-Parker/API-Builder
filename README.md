API-Builder
===========

The IDDS API Builder is a tool for converting Instrument Driver Excel API specifications into compatible Instrument Driver Development Studio (IDDS) files. This allows the developer to work more efficiently by not having to re-translate the API into the IDDS and ultimately convert his/her API directly into LabVIEW code. By following the structure and grammar outlined in this document, one will be able to compile an Excel spreadsheet with the API Builder tool.
